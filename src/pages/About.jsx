        <h3>
          Unlike other housing marketplace, our profits go directly to plant
          trees and restore forests
        </h3>
        <p>
          Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount
          of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our
          waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many species of
          wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection,
          and homes for many birds and mammals.

        <p className="pageHeader">Why Treehouses?</p>
        <h4>It’s beneficial to your health!</h4>
        <p>
          Humans may overlook the beauty of nature because it is so commonplace.
          As a result, our mental health suffers. After spending a lot of time
          in the city, spending time in nature might help us recharge and feel
          better. No wonder “forest therapy” is so effective!
        </p>
        <h4>Connect with your inner child!</h4>
        <p>
          Adults of our generation tend to feel that life was simpler and less
          complicated when they were children. They’d do everything to relive
          that moment, even if it was just for a few minutes. You’ll feel like a
          kid again during staying in a treehouse. In a treehouse, you may
          relive old memories or create new ones in a fun and creative way.
          Traveling with children? They’ll have an adventure of a lifetime.
        </p>
        <h4>You can enjoy amazing vistas</h4>
        <p>
          Birds and trees are all around you as you start your day off. Staying
          in a treehouse allows you to have a closer look at the forest without
          worrying about encountering any dangerous creatures. Some are hidden
          deep in the woods, while others are more accessible. Nevertheless,
          breathtaking views are one of the many benefits of staying in a tree
          house, no matter where you choose to stay.
